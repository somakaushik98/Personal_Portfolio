       I am Sai Kaushik Soma, a dedicated, enthusiastic student pursuing Master‚Äôs in Data Science at University of California , San Diego. 
       I have keen interest in understanding and extracting essential insights from the data. 
       This keen interest has a developed me to enhance my skills by exploring different frameworks and other softwares which help 
       in building an end to end application that is capable of giving required results using optimised methodologies and user satisfaction.
       I have written my own book on machine learning where I would like to spread my knowledge and skills to that set of students who are interested to enter machine learning as beginners. 
       I am also a blogger on medium where I write articles related to machine learning and Data Science

          - [Simple T5](https://pypi.org/project/simplet5/) : SimpleT5 is built on top of PyTorch-lightning‚ö°Ô∏è and Transformersü§ó that 
            lets you quickly train/fine-tune T5 models. With simpleT5 ‚Äî 
            It is very easy to fine-tune any T5 model on your dataset (Pandas dataframe )‚Äî 
            for any task (summarization, translation, question-answering, or other sequence-to-sequence tasks), 
            just ‚Äî import, instantiate, download a pre-trained model and train.
          - [KeyPhraseTransformer](https://pypi.org/project/keyphrasetransformer/): KeyPhraseTransformer (light-weight version), built on T5 transformer, 
            lets you quickly extract key-phrases,topics or themes from your text data. 
            KeyPhraseTransformer (LW) is trained on 100,000 training samples across domains.
